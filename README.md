# Art-with-code

These are a few examples we used in the Art-with-Code workshop that we did in the [Uppsala women coding](https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-women-coding-beginners-welcome/)
group (Uppsala, Sweden). 

In the index.html file the exercises and examples are in order from easy to hard. Go create some art with code!

Here are the slides in one image, all the code we used is in this repository. Thanks to [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) for existing.

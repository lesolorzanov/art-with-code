# Art-with-code

These are a few examples we used in the Art-with-Code workshop that we did in the [Uppsala women coding](https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-women-coding-beginners-welcome/)
group (Uppsala, Sweden). Here are the slides in one image, all the code we used is in this repository. Thanks to [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) for existing.
